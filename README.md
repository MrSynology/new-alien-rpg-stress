# Alien RPG â€“ Stress System Macros for Foundry VTT

This repository contains two macros designed for use with the **Alien RPG** system in **Foundry Virtual Tabletop (VTT)**. These macros implement the *new stress system* introduced by **Free League Publishing**, allowing for smoother gameplay automation.

## ðŸ“¦ Contents

The repository includes the following macros:

* **Combat Stress**
  Use this macro in any situation **other than** a skill roll (e.g., during combat encounters, panic events, or environmental triggers).

* **Skill Stress**
  Use this macro specifically when making **skill-based rolls** that require stress dice.

## ðŸ›  Installation

To install these macros in Foundry VTT:

1. Open Foundry VTT and load your Alien RPG world.
2. Navigate to the **Macros** tab.
3. Create a new macro and copy-paste the contents of the desired script from this repository.
4. Assign an icon and name to the macro.
5. Drag it to your hotbar for quick access.

Foundry VTT has [excellent documentation and community guides](https://foundryvtt.com/article/macros/) if youâ€™re unfamiliar with macro setup.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

* These macros are tailored for the **Alien RPG system** and may not function correctly with other game systems.
* Ensure you have the latest version of the Alien RPG system module installed in Foundry VTT.
